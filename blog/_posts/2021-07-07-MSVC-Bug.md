title: An Odd MSVC Bug
draft: true
---

While I was working on [Dawn](/projects/dawn), I ran into a curious bug in the Visual Studio 2019 C++ compiler. I reported it to the bug tracker, where it was confirmed to be an interference analysis issue. It was eventually fixed nearly a year later in 2020. However, I still don't know what caused the issue in the first place.

The problem arose upon implementing a Perlin noise type for procedural solid texturing. My type just so happened to include a 4-kilobyte array of pre-initialized random data, and this precise size caused writes to the data to interfere with a preceding struct member. The resulting bug ended up bricking the output of my path tracer&mdash;but only with optimizations enabled!

Assuming there was some bug in my code, I was able to narrow down the problem to an unintended write occurring just before the Perlin data. However, I simply could not figure what exactly was causing the write. These kind of issues (especially when only showing up due to optimizations) are typically a symptom of relying on undefined behavior, but there was no undefined behavior here. Hence, I started stripping out pieces of my code until I could minimally reproduce the issue. Eventually, I checked whether my code worked as expected in GCC and Clang, and it did: my issue was a rare compiler bug that resulted in broken codegen. 

I was able to capture the issue in the following example:
```c++
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstdio>

struct data {
    uint8_t _data[4095] = {};
};

struct container {

    uint8_t type = 1;
    data n;

    static container make() {

        container ret;
        
        printf("Before: %d\n", (int)ret.type);
        ret.n = data{};
        printf("After: %d\n", (int)ret.type);

        return ret;
    }
    
    container() {}
    container(const container& o) {}
};

void func(container c) {}

void main() {
    func(container::make());
}
```

Which resulted in the following output when compiled via `cl bug.cpp -O2`:
```
Before: 1
After: 0
```

My example seemed wildly specific. In fact, each of the following changes would correct the output:
- Changing `_data[4095]` to `_data[4094]` or smaller
- Removing the container copy constructor
- Removing the call to `func()`
- Making an unrelated call to `container::make()` before `func()`

With the help of [compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/z/5a9v99988), we can attempt to figure out what the issue actually was, and even see what changed when it was fixed. Bisecting the compiler versions shows that the assembly output has been quite stable over time, only changing with the jump from version 19.24 to 19.25.

Examining the output (x86, `-O2`), we can find that the only relevant code is in `main` - the relevant function calls have all been inlined. Comparing between the two compiler versions reveals that they are almost identical: the only change is to allocate extra stack space, preventing two temporaries from overlapping. 

```asm
    $T1 = 32
--  $T2 = 32
++  $T2 = 4128
--  $T3 = 4128
++  $T3 = 8224
    main PROC ; COMDAT
    $LN13:
        mov QWORD PTR [rsp+8], rsi
        push rdi
--      mov eax, 8224 ; 00002020H
++      mov eax, 12320 ; 00003020H
        call __chkstk
        sub rsp, rax
        lea rdi, QWORD PTR $T2[rsp]
        mov ecx, 4096 ; 00001000H
        lea rsi, QWORD PTR $T3[rsp]
        xor edx, edx
        rep movsb
        lea rsi, QWORD PTR $T2[rsp]
        mov r8d, 4095 ; 00000fffH
        lea rcx, QWORD PTR [rsi+1]
        mov BYTE PTR [rsi], 1
        call memset
        movzx edx, BYTE PTR [rsi]
        lea rcx, OFFSET FLAT:`string'
        call printf
        xor edx, edx
        lea rcx, QWORD PTR $T1[rsp]
        mov r8d, 4095 ; 00000fffH
        call memset
        lea rcx, QWORD PTR [rsi+1]
        mov r8d, 4095 ; 00000fffH
        lea rdx, QWORD PTR $T1[rsp]
        call memcpy
        movzx edx, BYTE PTR [rsi]
        lea rcx, OFFSET FLAT:`string'
        call printf
--      mov rsi, QWORD PTR [rsp+8240]
++      mov rsi, QWORD PTR [rsp+12336]
        xor eax, eax
--      add rsp, 8224 ; 00002020H
++      add rsp, 12320 ; 00003020H
        pop rdi
        ret 0
    main ENDP
```
