A dedicated reader might notice that although I've updated my projects, I haven't written a post in almost three years. 

<!--end_excerpt-->

Coincidentally enough, that time period corresponds to my first six semesters at CMU&mdash;they were, overall, [quite busy](/cmu). I've still got one semester left, and it will again be quite busy. This time, however, I'll be working on grad school applications, so I'm planning on procrastinating those by writing some new articles. I've got a backlog of ideas and topics lying around, and I've done several projects that warrant exposition. I've also started working on re-writing [Exile](/projects/exile), which has generated quite a few interesting thoughts.
