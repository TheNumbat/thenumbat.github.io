A dedicated reader might notice that although I've updated my projects, I haven't written a post in almost three years.

Strangely enough, this corresponds to my first six semesters at CMU&mdash;it has been, overall, quite busy. I've still got one semester left, and it will be again, quite busy. But this time, let's see if I can procrastinate via writing some articles. I've got quite the backlog of ideas and topics lying around, and I've done several  projects that warrant some exposition. I've also semi-recently started working on re-writing [Exile](/projects/exile), which has generated quite a few more thoughts.
