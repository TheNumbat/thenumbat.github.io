A handmade-style voxel game engine. Currently working on a re-write.

I worked on the first version of Exile from 2017-2019, which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheNumbat/exile). As a learning experience, I implemented everything without using any libraries. It included the following features:
- Custom C-like standard library
- Type reflection and generic serialization through metaprogramming
- OpenGL 4.5 deferred renderer with an optimized voxel mesh pipeline, post-processing, dynamic lighting, and MSAA
- Asynchronous voxel world generation and meshing
- Platform abstraction layer wrapping Win32 or SDL2 and supporting hot code reloading
- CPU and memory usage profiling system
- Asset pipeline

I also wrote several [blog posts](/) about the various systems.

As of 2021, I'm working on a complete re-write of the project (though it is progressing slowly). So far, it includes a modern C++ standard library, a Vulkan renderer using hardware accelerated ray tracing, a multiplayer server, and in-depth procedural world generation. Look out for fresh blog posts about these systems!
