Carnegie Mellon University's educational graphics software package. Includes projects in interactive 3D mesh editing, path tracing, dynamic animation, and physics-based simulation.

During my three semesters as a teaching assistant for CMU's introductory computer graphics course (15-462/662), I re-wrote the infrastructure students use to implement course projects. I'm now maintaining our codebase as an open source project. 

Scotty3D has many of the technical and GUI features of a full 3D package like Blender, but several algorithms are stripped out for students to implement. Students are given code scaffolding and instructions for the following assignments:
- 3D mesh editing and geometry processing with half-edge meshes 
- Path tracing with BVHs, various material models, next event estimation, and environment lighting
- Animation with splines, keyframes, skeletal rigs, and particle based simulations

You can read more about the course on the CMU [website](http://15462.courses.cs.cmu.edu/) and find Scotty3D on [GitHub](https://github.com/CMU-Graphics/Scotty3D).

If you'd like to learn computer graphics, each assignment is publicly available on the [documentation website](https://cmu-graphics.github.io/Scotty3D/). Even better, all lectures from the fall 2020 semester are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9_jI1bdZmz2emSh0UQ5iOdT2xRHFHL7E) courtesy of professor [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/).
