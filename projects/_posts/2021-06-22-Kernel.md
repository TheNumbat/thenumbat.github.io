x86 Kernel supporting device drivers, preemptive multitasking, virtual memory protection, threading, and virtual terminals. Written from scratch for CMU 15-410.

During the spring semester of 2020, along with a partner, I wrote an x86 kernel supporting most features necessary for a multitasking OS. We implemented the kernel from scratch in C and x86 assembly.

Features:
- Keyboard, timer, and terminal device drivers
- User/kernel space division and syscall interface
- Process and thread management with fork/exec/wait/thread_fork/exit
- Per-process virtual memory protection with page tables
- Preemptive multitasking and scheduler including preemptible syscalls
- Atomics and synchronization primitives 
- User-space threading library 
- Virtual/multiplexed terminal devices 
- Runs on real hardware
- A few concurrency bugs, but at least they didn't show up...

Unfortunately, booting it up again would take some build system work that I don't feel like doing. 

However, I found an old work-in-progress screenshot, running on an i5-6400:
