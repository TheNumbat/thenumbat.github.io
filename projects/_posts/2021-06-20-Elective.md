At my high school, I developed and taught lessons on C++ programming, data structures, and 2D game development with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/).

From 2015 to 2017, I developed and taught a weekly computer science elective course at my high school. It covered C++ programming, 2D game development with [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/), and some basic data structures & algorithms. 

I also compiled much of the curriculum into a [website](https://thenumbat.github.io/cpp-course/) that now gets a couple thousand monthly views. 

Topics:
- Basic programming concepts in C++
- OOP and templates in C++
- Sorting, lists, stacks, queues, heaps, binary search trees
- C++ STL
- Windowing, input, rendering, textures, sound, and physics with SDL2
- Basic threading, functional programming, and game engine patterns
