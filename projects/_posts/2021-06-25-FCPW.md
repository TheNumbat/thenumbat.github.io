FCPW is a C++ library for fast closest point and ray intersection queries. 

I wrote a [report](/assets/projects/fcpw-report.pdf) evaluating various strategies for parallelizing closest point queries on the CPU and GPU.

I worked on this project during the spring semester of 2021. My advisors were [Rohan Sawhney](http://rohansawhney.io/) and [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/) of the CMU [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/). 

You can find the [FCPW library](https://github.com/rohan-sawhney/fcpw) and [my GPU strategies](https://github.com/TheNumbat/GPU-RT/tree/FCPW-GPU) on GitHub.
