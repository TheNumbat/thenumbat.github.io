FCPW is a C++ library for fast closest point and ray intersection queries. 

I wrote a [report](/assets/projects/fcpw-report.pdf) evaluating various strategies for parallelizing closest point queries on the CPU and GPU.

I worked on this project during the spring semester of 2021. I was advised by [Rohan Sawhney](http://rohansawhney.io/) and [Keenan Crane](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/) of the CMU [Geometry Collective](http://geometry.cs.cmu.edu/).
