Simple but optimized CPU path tracer based on Peter Shirley's ray tracing series.

<!--end_excerpt-->

---

During the summer of 2019, I wrote a simple CPU path tracer based on Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/) series. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheNumbat/Dawn).

It supports the following features:
- Material-sampled path tracing
- Diffuse, glossy, and transparent materials
- Depth of field
- Motion blur
- Bounding volume hierarchy for intersection queries
- Solid texturing with Perlin noise
- Texture maps
- Emissive lights
- Homogeneous volumetric scattering (also used for subsurface scattering)
- Rendering GUI 

Additionally, I implemented the following performance optimizations:
- Switching the guide's OOP style to a data-oriented design
- Tiled multi-threaded rendering
- SIMD vector math and intersection logic 

## Results
