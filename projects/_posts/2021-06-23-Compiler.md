Compiler from a safe C-like language to x86 assembly. Includes SSA conversion, SCCP, register allocation, and a languageâ€‘level threading library. Written from scratch for CMU 15-411.

During the fall semester of 2020, along with a partner, I wrote a compiler for the [C0 programming language](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15122-f10/misc/c0-reference.pdf). We implemented all parts of the compiler from scratch in Rust. 

## Optimizations

In addition to compiling the base language, we implemented a variety of high and low level optimization strategies and analyzed our results:

## Language-Level Parallelism 

For our final project, we designed and implemented a language extension (C-SPAN) for easily writing parallel programs:
