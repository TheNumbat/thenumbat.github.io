GPU-RT was my final project for CMU 15-468 (physics-based rendering) during the spring semester of 2021. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheNumbat/GPU-RT). My showcase render won the technical award at the course's 2021 [rendering competition](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-468/rendering_competition.html).
