## Projects

### Exile

[GitHub](https://github.com/TheNumbat/exile)

A handmade-style voxel engine & game.

Objective is to create a featureful low-level programming environment & voxel game engine with minimal libraries, to dig into and perfect critical and noncritical systems, and to create a modded-minecraft-like game on top of the engine.

Goals:
   - High quality graphics (lighting, render distance, fast movement, large worlds)
   - Interesting and variable procedural terrain & feature generation
   - Powerful & complex player-managed systems (e.g. modded minecraft/factorio)
   - Smooth multiplayer and efficient servers
   - Flexible & powerful modding support
